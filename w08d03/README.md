# W08D03 - End-to-End Testing with Cypress

### To Do
- [x] Jest vs Cypress
- [x] Install and Configure Cypress
- [x] Design End-to-End Tests with Cypress

### Jest vs Cypress
* Jest:
  * command line test runner
  * works great for unit/integration tests
  * does not actually run a browser
  * embeds the test code in the src
* Cypress:
  * browser-based
  * actually visits your website like a user
  * test code is adjacent to the src
