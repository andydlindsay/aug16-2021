# W10D01 - Rails Review

### To Do
- [x] "Rails Week" Conversation
- [x] MVC Review
- [x] Quickly build simple Rails app
- [x] Nested Resources

### Rails Convo
* I like it (Rails)
* Hard to tell where Ruby ends and Rails begins
* I like the MVC system
* Thinking of using Rails for the final
* Generate was very useful
* AR is too tightly coupled to the DB

### MVC
* Model => interaction with the database (data)
* View => templating engine, form helpers (server-side rendering)
* Controller => brains, connects everything together
